                A large number of payment problems are not caused by unwillingness to pay.
                They are caused by <strong>timing mismatches</strong> — paydays that move,
                bank holidays, rigid collection dates, and systems that assume humans will
                always remember and intervene at the right moment.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project explores a different approach.

                What if payment systems adapted to real cashflow,
                rather than punishing people when reality doesn’t line up with fixed schedules?

            <h2>What this is</h2>

            <p>
                This is an exploratory project focused on <strong>payment execution</strong> — specifically:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>understanding when payments are most likely to succeed</li>
                <li>reducing failed attempts and retries</li>
                <li>preventing avoidable downstream harm (fees, arrears, stress)</li>
                <li>making execution predictable without removing choice</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The emphasis is on <strong>automation and context</strong>,
                not behaviour change or budgeting.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What this is not</h2>

            <p>This project is <strong>not</strong>:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>a bank</li>
                <li>a payment method</li>
                <li>a credit product</li>
                <li>a budgeting app</li>
                <li>financial advice</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                It does not hold money, initiate payments, or make decisions on a person’s behalf.
            </p>

            <p>
                It explores how <strong>better timing signals and execution logic</strong>
                could sit alongside existing payment systems to reduce failure.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>The core idea</h2>

            <p>
                People don’t think in payment rails or settlement windows.
                They think in outcomes:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>“Don’t let this go late by accident”</li>
                <li>“Don’t take money before I’m paid”</li>
                <li>“If this can’t be paid, tell me early”</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Modern systems rarely support that intent.
            </p>

            <p>
                This work looks at how <strong>read-only financial context</strong>,
                combined with explicit consent and narrow scope, could be used to:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>signal safer execution windows</li>
                <li>avoid high-risk attempts</li>
                <li>surface insufficiency earlier</li>
                <li>reduce the need for retries and escalation</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why this matters</h2>

            <p>
                Failed payments create costs on all sides:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>customers face fees, stress, and reputational harm</li>
                <li>billers face retries, support calls, arrears management, and volatility</li>
                <li>systems become more punitive to compensate for uncertainty</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Reducing <em>avoidable</em> failure benefits everyone —
                without relying on penalties or blame.

            <h2>Current status</h2>

            <p>
                This is early-stage, exploratory work.
            </p>

            <p>
                The repository contains:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>a short white paper outlining the model and constraints</li>
                <li>a simulation engine to test execution scenarios</li>
                <li>no production code</li>
                <li>no live service</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The goal is clarity and scrutiny before any further steps.
            </p>
