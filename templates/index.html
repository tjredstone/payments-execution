        <!-- PROBLEM -->
        <section class="section">
            <p>
                A large number of payment problems are not caused by unwillingness to pay.
                They are caused by <strong>timing mismatches</strong> — paydays that move,
                bank holidays, rigid collection dates, and systems that assume humans will
                always remember and intervene at the right moment.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project explores a different approach.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                What if payment systems adapted to real cashflow,
                rather than punishing people when reality doesn’t line up with fixed schedules?

        <!-- CORE IDEA -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>The core idea</h2>

            <p>People don’t think in payment rails or settlement windows. They think in outcomes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>“Don’t let this go late by accident”</li>
                <li>“Don’t take money before I’m paid”</li>
                <li>“If this can’t be paid, tell me early”</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This work explores how <strong>read-only financial context</strong>,
                explicit consent, and narrow scope could be used to:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>signal safer execution windows</li>
                <li>avoid high-risk attempts</li>
                <li>surface insufficiency earlier</li>
                <li>reduce retries and escalation</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Why this matters</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Customers face fees, stress, and reputational harm</li>
                <li>Billers face retries, support calls, arrears management, and volatility</li>
                <li>Systems become punitive to compensate for uncertainty</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Reducing <em>avoidable</em> failure benefits everyone —
                without relying on penalties or blame.

        <!-- STATUS -->

            <h2>Current status</h2>

            <ul>

            </ul>

            <p>
                The goal is clarity and scrutiny before any further steps.
