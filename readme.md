# Payments Execution Infrastructure

This project explores an alternative approach to personal finance and payments,
focused on execution timing, automation, and harm reduction.

The repository contains:
- A public-facing website outlining the concept
- A white paper describing the model and constraints
- A simulation engine to test execution strategies

This is an exploratory project, not a financial product.
